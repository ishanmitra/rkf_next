                                                It is a 5 days workshop (25 hours in total) program which talks about all the important aspects of comprehensive gender and sexuality education. Our module is inclusive, respectful of diversity and pretty simple to follow through. It covers concepts of personal space, consent, bodily autonomy, gender, sexuality, gender roles/stereotypes, gender based violence, mental health, sexual and reproductive health and rights etc. It is based on the 7 essential components standardised and recognised by International Planned Parenthood Federation.

                                                Launched in 2023, Project Tamanna is an initiative under the larger My Body My Rights Program. It is a knowledge building program in government schools in and around Kolkata that aims to work with adolescents in school and classroom set up to initiate conversations around safety, child rights, digital safety, sexual and reproductive health, menstrual health literacy. This pioneering initiative is not just another educational program—it&apos;s a transformative journey aimed at empowering young minds with knowledge, skills, and confidence. At its core, Project Tamanna seeks to create a safer and more informed environment for children by initiating crucial conversations around safety, child rights, digital literacy, and sexual and reproductive health. The first component of Project Tamanna is a school level awareness program designed to engage adolescents attending government schools and the second component is the peer leader component which plays a pivotal role in extending the program&apos;s impact beyond the classroom. Peer leaders are equipped not only to educate their peers but also to serve as advocates for important issues affecting adolescents in their schools and communities. Project Tamanna ensures that accurate knowledge resonates far beyond the initial sessions, creating a ripple effect of empowerment and advocacy throughout the community.

                                                Project Priyo, an initiative by Rangeen Khidki Foundation, is dedicated to celebrating and amplifying stories at the intersection of caste, religion, marginalisation, and queerness. With a firm belief in the transformative power of storytelling, Project Priyo centres the experiences of queer-trans* individuals, ensuring their voices are not just heard but honoured. This initiative is committed to leveraging technology through a queer-feminist lens, drawing inspiration from fem-tech movements to dismantle structural inequalities and elevate marginalised narratives. Alongside storytelling, Project Priyo actively conducts gender and sexuality-based workshops, awareness programs, and fellowships that focus on intersectional feminist principles and the rights of all marginalised identities. Expanding upon its foundational phase, Project Priyo&apos;s goals are threefold: documenting and sharing untold stories, sensitising youth aged 15 to 21 through comprehensive education, and empowering communities with resources for digital storytelling and gender and sexuality sensitization. Through collaboration and outreach, Project Priyo strives to reach diverse audiences, break down barriers, and foster inclusivity. By driving meaningful change and advocating for LGBTQI+ rights, the project envisions a future where every voice is valued, every story celebrated, and every identity respected.

                                                Launched in 2023, Project Tamanna is an initiative under the larger My Body My Rights Program. It is a knowledge building program in government schools in and around Kolkata that aims to work with adolescents in school and classroom set up to initiate conversations around safety, child rights, digital safety, sexual and reproductive health, menstrual health literacy. This pioneering initiative is not just another educational program—it&apos;s a transformative journey aimed at empowering young minds with knowledge, skills, and confidence. At its core, Project Tamanna seeks to create a safer and more informed environment for children by initiating crucial conversations around safety, child rights, digital literacy, and sexual and reproductive health. The first component of Project Tamanna is a school level awareness program designed to engage adolescents attending government schools and the second component is the peer leader component which plays a pivotal role in extending the program&apos;s impact beyond the classroom. Peer leaders are equipped not only to educate their peers but also to serve as advocates for important issues affecting adolescents in their schools and communities. Project Tamanna ensures that accurate knowledge resonates far beyond the initial sessions, creating a ripple effect of empowerment and advocacy throughout the community.
